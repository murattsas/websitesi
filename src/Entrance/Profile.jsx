                    <p>I graduated from Istanbul Beykent University with a degree in Computer Engineering. Throughout my education, I have placed great importance on reinforcing the theoretical knowledge and skills I gained by applying them in real-world projects. With a strong interest in technology and software, I am always eager to learn and improve myself.

                        I gained valuable experience in corporate IT infrastructure and banking technologies during my internship at TEB Bank's IT department. Additionally, I contributed to software development processes and project management during my internship at NeoKod R&D Software Company in Ankara. These experiences strengthened my teamwork and problem-solving skills.

                        I am motivated to continuously grow and learn new technologies in my career. My goal is to add value to the projects I work on and make a meaningful impact in the technology field.</p>
